LABELING GUIDE FOR YOLOv8 TRAINING

IMPORTANT: One image can contain MULTIPLE classes!

If an image contains:
- Person visible (even partially) = Put in person/ folder
- Obstacles visible (boxes, chairs) = Also label them in annotations
- Both person AND obstacles = Put in person/ folder, label BOTH

FOLDER RULES:
1. person/ folder:
   - Images where person is visible (primary target)
   - Even if obstacles are also in the frame
   - Person is the main focus

2. obstacles/ folder:
   - Images with ONLY obstacles (no person)
   - Use for learning obstacle shapes

3. background/ folder:
   - Empty scenes (no person, no obstacles)
   - Helps model learn what NOT to detect

ANNOTATION FORMAT (YOLO):
Each image needs a .txt file with same name:
  class_id center_x center_y width height
  (all values normalized 0.0 to 1.0)

Example: image.png -> image.txt
  0 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.4    (person at center)
  1 0.3 0.7 0.15 0.1  (obstacle on left)

Class IDs:
  0 = person
  1 = obstacles
  2 = background (usually no annotations needed)

YOUR CASE (person behind obstacle but taller):
- Put image in person/ folder
- Create annotation file labeling BOTH:
  * Person bounding box (class 0)
  * Obstacle bounding box (class 1)
- This teaches model to detect person even when obstacles are present
